# Weather-Dashboard
Server-Side APIs Challenge

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to showcase potential employers my ability to create a fully funtional weather dahsboard

WHEN you open the webpage, a box will appear with the name of a city, the current date and an emoji displaying the expected weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.), temperature, wind, and humidity

THEN columns can be seen underneath the box displaying the 5-day forecast for that city

WHEN you search for a new city to left side of the screen

THEN  a list appears underneath the search box of the past cities that have been searched for

## Usage

FIRST make a header with "Weather Dashboard"

THEN setup moment to get the current date's weather and add a corresponding emoji

THEN get API key from weather website

THEN specify the city's that are going to be used

THEN  connect the city's elements to local storage
